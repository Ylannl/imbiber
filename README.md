# imbiber

Imbiber generates nicely formatted HTML from BibTeX files. It can be called directly or from [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Depending on the options passed, it outputs all the entries of a file (sorted and grouped) or a single one.

It is meant to substitute [bibhtmler](https://github.com/kenohori/bibhtmler). More info to come.
